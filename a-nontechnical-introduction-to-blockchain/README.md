# A non-technical introduction to Blockchain and the future of money (aka blockchain is not the new internet, it's much more profound)

In today's world, your paycheck comes once every two weeks, Credit card fees make it harder for Small Businesses to serve their communities, and it can take up to 3 days to transfer money between Bank Accounts. 3 DAYS!!! Not to mention there are fees for literally EVERYTHING. Minimum fees, overdraft fees, maximum fees, hidden fees. And the people collecting these fees already have the majority of the world's wealth.

But wait. In today's world cars are starting to drive themselves, people are talking about colonizing mars, and a budget mobile phone is as powerful as the most expensive computer from 15 years ago. How the crap are we living in both of these worlds at once? What is wrong with this picture and what's to be done about it?

The short answer is, our financial system is extremely outdated and it was built by people who profit from its design. But technology is finally catching up to these crusty old financial institutions. And it's called Blockchain.

## Who is this article for? (non-techies)
If you're reading this, chances are you've heard of Blockchain, (you've definitely heard of Bitcoin) but don't quite know what it is or why you should care. Well you aren't alone! It's typically a very confusing topic steeped in financial and technical jargon that can be hard to decipher for those of us that are not engineers, scientists, or financial advisors.

In this article I will attempt to demystify the lingo laden technology known as Blockchain (and cryptocurrncy by extension) without using words like "non-fungible", "immutable public ledger", and "trustless consensus". Those words suck.

## Why is Blockchain so important?
Our financial system is outdated, inefficient, and full of inequity. Poor people pay billions of dollars in unnecessary fees every year while rich people make billions by exploiting tax loopholes. Blockchain, in simple terms, is a technology foundation that enables a radically different financial system to be built upon. And this time it's being built by nerds from all backgrounds, ages, races, and genders. Not just rich old white dudes. Think about the possibilities!

## What does a Blockchain future look like?
Imagine a world where your paycheck was paid to you daily, or hourly, or every second instead of once every 2 weeks. In fact, you could choose whatever time interval you wanted. Maybe you love pie so you get paid every 3.14 days. That really shouldn't be a revolutionary idea. **And Blockchain already enables this!!!**
Imagine if credit card fees were fixed at 1% or lower with no floor. Small businesses would no longer have to force customers to pay a minimum in order to make credit card purchases. Or force you to pay the fee they would have to pay. Now imagine if we got rid of credit cards all together but you still earned airline miles from making purchases. Or what if you could choose from 1000 different rewards? What would that world look like?
Now here's a much more radical idea. Imagine a world where there were no banks, but your money was just as securely protected. No more ATM fees, overdraft fees, fees to open a new account or other hidden fees you aren't even aware of. That's not to say there won't be some small fees, but the fee structure will be simple, you'll know what the fees are ahead of time.
And the best part is, fees are no longer just a one way street! YOU could even sign up to collect fees from other people in the system! And possibly even more bonkers is that the fees you pay could get lower as more people enter the system. Or the fee structure could be lower or higher based on income. It's even possible that the fee structure is decided by a vote, so everyone in the system gets to weigh in on the decision instead of just a board of directors at some greedy organization run by billionaires. And I should mention that in this system voter fraud is virtually impossible.


## Ok Mr. Utopia. What is blockchain exactly?
Up to this point I've been filling your head primarily with hypotheticals and dreams of utopia. But I assure you some form of everything you just read is already in development. Just on a small scale. Now it's time to come back to earth. In this section I will do my best to provide a description of the nuts and bolts that make up Blockchain Technology in completely non-technical terms. It's actually very simple and easy to understand.

The most important use-case for blockchain has to do with money and transactions so let's start there. Back in the old days, before computers existed, every business had an accountant or bookkeeper to keep track of the purchases people made. The bookkeeper would record all of these purchases (aka transactions) in a journal (book) called a "ledger". In this ledger they would write down the date and time of every transaction, the amount paid by the customer in whatever currency was the standard of their region, and the quantity or description of items the customer purchased. The whole point of this system was to help the business keep track of how much money they had, and how many items they had left. I'm glossing over some details but let's keep it simple.

## Buying a sandwich in Ztopia
So let's say you lived in the mythical land of Ztopia. The currency people use to buy things is called ZCoin. You are feeling hungry so you go to the market to buy a grilled cheese sandwich. You give 5 ZCoin to the shopkeeper at your favorite sandwich shop and in return they give you a sandwich. Then you go sit in a park and eat lunch. At the same time, the sandwich shop's bookkeeper records this transaction in their ledger, along with all of the other transactions that have ever taken place at the shop. Of course you don't care about the bookkeeper and may not have even noticed (unless you're also a bookkeeper). All you care about is eating this dank-ass sandwich. And it sure is delicious! And all the shopkeeper cares about is making sure they have enough money to pay rent and that they don't run out of cheese and bread.

But how does anyone outside the sandwich shop know that you actually paid for the cheese sandwich and didn't in fact steal it from someone else? Well this is where the idea of a "public ledger" comes into play. All this means is that instead of each business having their own private ledger (book of transactions), they all use a single publicly accessible ledger.

Pretend for a minute that every bookkeeper in Ztopia has a magic pen. Whenever an individual bookkeeper records a transaction in their own ledger, it is ALSO magically recorded in the ledger of every other bookkeeper in the whole land. Furthermore, whenever new transactions appear in these "decentralized" or "distributed" ledgers, each bookkeeper quickly verifies that the transaction actually occured by looking back at every transaction since the beginning of time to make sure everything adds up. These bookkeepers are superhuman! 

There are many benefits to this system (and also a few drawbacks but I won't be covering those yet). The beauty of this system is that if you forget how much you paid for your sandwich, or if someone tries to accuse you of stealing it, you can just stop by any shop in Ztopia, ask the bookkeeper to see the public ledger and verify that you did indeed pay for that sandwhich and exactly how much you paid. If the shop goes out of business, it won't cause a problem because all of the transactions that occured in that shop are still accessible at any other shop in Ztopia.

In this hypothetical situation, the public ledger that the bookkeepers are using is essentially what a Blockchain is. It is a public (anyone can go into a shop to see it), decentralized (an entire copy exists at each shop) ledger (record of transactions) dating back to the beginning of time. And the ZCoin in this case is a cryptocurrency.

## How does Blockchain actually work?
Now let's go a few layers deeper. But I promise to keep it light. You may be thinking "so wait a minute...anybody has the ability to see any transaction that has ever occured? Doesn't that mean if I bought something and I didn't want people to know about, I would have no way of covering it up?" This is where we introduce the concept of a "private key", which essentially just means a secret password that only you know. What I didn't mention earlier, was that when you paid for the sandwich you actually also used your private key as a signature for the transaction. Kind of like how you might use an actual signature to prove that it was YOU who authorized a transaction on your Credit Card. Or sort of like using your thumbprint or face recognition when you make payments with your phone today. Your thumbprint or the outline of your face is stored in a digital form on a special chip on your phone and never leaves that chip. If someone wanted to use your money to buy things, they would have to have YOUR phone and YOUR thumb or face.

This is one of the most important concepts in the entire system. As long as only YOU know your secret password, then nobody else will know what you've purchased or be able to steal your Zcoin. But you may be wondering "ok but if I use my private key as a signature so that everyone else knows it was me who bought the sandwich...doesn't that mean that my private key is visible in the public ledger too?" Great question. The other missing piece of the puzzle is where the term "crypto" comes from. It's short for "cryptography". Again, you don't need to know anything about cryptography to understand how it works.

Now pretend that when you paid for the sandwich, the bookkeeper handed you a special device called a HashMachine. It looks a lot like a credit card reader that you have used in the past. The difference here is that instead of writing your name on the screen (or holding your phone next to it while using your thumb/face) you input your secret password (private key) instead. Just make sure nobody is looking ;) The job of the HashMachine is quite simple. It takes your secret password and spits out a random string of numbers and letters that is completely different from what you put in. This provides anonymity. Then the bookkeeper records this anonymized version in the ledger along with the date/time, price, and the fact that you bought a sandwich.

What makes this system work is everytime you give the HashMachine your secret password, it spits out the same random string of numbers and letters. And THIS is how you can verify it was you. Sort of like a digital fingerprint or written signature. The other thing to know about the HashMachine is that it's a one way process. You can't put the publicly accessible version of your private key into it and expect to get your secret password. If you did this, you would just get another completely different string of numbers and letters. You'll just have to trust me on this one because this is the foundation of cryptography where things get extremely complex and I'm just a basic Ztopian trying to buy a sandwich.
