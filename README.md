# A non-technical introduction to Blockchain and the future of money (aka blockchain is not the new internet, it's much more profound). 

I believe there are two major problems that Blockchain technology faces today in terms of mass adoption and public perception. The first is that nobody understands why they should care about it. How will my life benefit from this technology? What are the short and long term impacts going to be? Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? The second is a misconception that it is "the new internet" when it is potentially much more profound.

The good news is, these are both marketing problems. Not technological ones. In this article I will try to explain in normal person terms (i.e. non-technical) what Blockchain actually promises to be and more importantly **WHY YOU**, someone who isn't a scientist or engineer, **should care**. And you should care A LOT.


## We fear that which we don't understand (aka the Turbo Encabulator problem)
One of the halmarks of any emerging technological innovation cycle is the language used to describe said technology is often composed entirely of technobabble that only by the scientists and engineers involved can understand. But in order for new technology to be widely adopted and, more importantly understood, it needs to be accessible to the non-technical majority. This means that language and metaphors need to be established so that anyone can have a meaningful conversation about it. Eventually technical terms may permeate the fabric of society (the word "server" for example), but we aren't there yet.

If I asked someone today to explain what Blockchain is and why I should care, they would likely respond with something like this:

1. Actually I don't care.
2. All I know is I bought some Bitcoin last month and now it's worth twice as much!
3. Because it's a decentralized and immutable public ledger for transacting fungible and non-fungible tokens, which operates on trustless consensus using a proof of work validation method. Duh.
4. I like turtles

So let me ask you this. Which answer was the most useful? Which one makes you feel like Blockchain is cool? Which answer makes you care? And which answer demonstrates the most practical knowledge of the subject? Here's a diagram that represents what I think:

< insert diagram here >

Answer number 3 is by far the least practical. In fact it's impacts are likely negative. It succeedes at one thing very well. Causing me to give up on trying to understand Blockchain. It's obviously a very complicated technology that I will never comprehend and neither will anybody else. The other answers are much more practical and relatable. I understand not caring. I understand doubling my money. And who doesn't like turtles?


## Greater than the sum of its parts
Now consider for a moment you were thinking of buying a car. So you ask someone "What's the difference between Honda and BMW?" and they answer by telling you all of the technical details of how an engine works and the tiny differences between manufacturers. You may end up buying a bike instead. This isn't a perfect metaphor but demonstrates one of the greatest problems Blockchain (and cryptocurrencies by extension) face today, which is a marketing problem. 

And I believe this problem is actually detrimental to the public perception and wider adoption of blockchain technology. If blockchain truly represents one of the greatest technological improvements in a generation, then we need to help people see the big picture and how it relates to everything else, not the nuts and bolts of how it works (the simple sum of its parts). We need to start capturing people's attention on the WHY and maybe a little bit of the HOW. But nobody cares about the inner workings. When talking about the WHAT, give the 10,000 foot view. Speaking of which...


## The WHAT: Blockchain is the new financial system. (NOT "the new internet")
Anyone who has seen the TV show Silicon Valley has been exposed to the idea that "the new internet" will be "decentralized" and "put an end to greedy corporations profiting off of our data." While this concept offered a very entertaining premise to the show Silicon Valley (which was painfully accurate in its depiction of Silicon Valley culture), I think it also may have fed into the idea that Blockchain and the decentralized web are somehow the same thing. While they are related, this equating of the two is very unfortunate because Blockchain alone is not capable of being the decentralized web, and in that case it will always overpromise and underdeliver. This is a really unfortunate circumstance because the actual applications for Blockchain are actually much more profound.

In simple terms, Blockchain can be thought of as the foundation of a revolutionary new financial system (more like Fight Club than HBO's Silicon Valley). One that is 10x more efficient, and more equitable for everyone (i.e. it could have a much lower negative impact on poor people than the current one does). One that helps people build wealth in ways they never thought possible instead of telling them they will never be wealthy while the rich get richer. I don't know about you, but that sounds a lot better than just a new internet. For most people the internet works pretty well. Not to mention [half the planet doesn't even use the internet](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/#:~:text=Almost%204.66%20billion%20people%20were,percent%20of%20total%20internet%20users.). But the entire world suffers at the hands of the current financial system. To make an even bolder statement, it could indicate a coming step change in Capitalism that we so desparately need to survive as a species. (I said it was bold didn't I!!)


## The WHY 1.0: Imagine a world with no hidden fees
So what does this new financial system look like and why should you care? Let me give a few examples ranging from already possible/happening to potentially longer term dreams.

* Imagine a world where your paycheck was paid to you daily, or hourly, or every second instead of once every 2 weeks. In fact, you could choose whatever time interval you wanted. Maybe you love pie so you get paid every 3.14 days. That really shouldn't be a revolutionary idea. But it is **and Blockchain already enables this!!!**
<br>
* Imagine a world where you only get charged for things you actually use. Remember that free trial for a fitness app you signed up for on January 1st and then never used but forgot to cancel? Now you have to pay an entire monthly or yearly subsciption just because you forgot to cancel. Wouldn't it be great if you only got charged when you used the app?

These two examples are not hypothetical. They are actually real capabilities currently enabled by existing Blockchains. But here are a couple slightly more radical ideas to ponder.


## The WHY 2.0: Imagine a world with no fine print
* Imagine a world where there are no banks, but your money was just as securely protected. No more ATM fees, overdraft fees, fees to open a new account or other hidden fees you aren't even aware of. That's not to say there won't be fees, but the fee structure will be simple, easy for you to understand before you join, and anyone can sign up to collect fees from other people in the system! Even more bonkers though is that the fees might get lower as more people enter the system. It's even possible that the fee structure is decided upon by everyone using the system casting a vote. Not by some greedy organization run by billionaires. And as an added bonus voter fraud is virtually impossible.
<br>
* Imagine if credit card fees were fixed at 1% or lower with no floor. Small businesses would no longer have to force customers to pay a minimum in order to make a credit card purchase. Or force you to pay the fee they would have to pay. Now imagine if we did away with credit cards all together but you still earned airline miles from making purchases. Or what if you could choose from 1000 different rewards? What would that world look like?
<br>
* Imagine if you wanted to borrow money to buy a car and instead of borrowing from a bank or some other crusty institution that charges a high interest rate, you were able to borrow from your friend or some other normal person and pay them an interest rate you agreed to instead.
<br>
* Imagine a world where taxes were calculated correctly every paycheck, and if you qualified for a deduction you would get that money back immediately? You wouldn't have to worry about if you owed the government tax money each year or if you've been paying more taxes than you should. In the current system you might get a tax return once a year, but wouldn't it have been nice if it were automatically invested in a high return savings account throughout the entire year instead? In this world you wouldn't have to pay a tax expert to calculate your income taxes. You wouldn't have to figure out which deductions to make or when you should sell an investment.


## Will this Blockchain dream become a reality?
Ok so that was a lot of hypotheticals. And it's not a guarantee that any or all of these will actually come to fruition in a large scale way. There will always be technical issues that need to be addressed, but perhaps the biggest challenge will come in the form of government regulations and competing corporate interests. And THIS is why shaping public perception and arming people with language around the subject will be ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL to widescale adoption.

One thing I can say for certain. There are a lot of really intelligent and privileged people who are working tirelessly to make this dream become a reality. And if history has a way of repeating itself, I'd say there's a pretty good chance that we'll know if this dream becomes reality sometime in the next 10 years. One way or the other it's going to be a wild ride for anyone involved. If this really is the beginning of the new financial system though, I hope we learn from the past and start developing practical language to help educate people about the potential future we are rocketing towards. Because it's going to have some very real repercussions if we don't.
